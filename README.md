# Clean Architecture Microservice Template

Welcome to the Clean Architecture Microservice Template built with .NET! This template provides a solid foundation to start building scalable and maintainable microservices using the principles of Clean Architecture. The template is structured into four main projects: Core, Use Cases, Infrastructure, and API.

## Project Structure

The solution is divided into the following projects:

- **Core**: Contains the domain layer.
- **Use Cases**: Contains the application layer.
- **Infrastructure**: Contains the infrastructure layer.
- **API**: Contains the presentation layer.

## Core Project

The Core project represents the domain layer of the application and contains:

- **Entities**: The core business objects.
- **Aggregates**: Aggregate roots which are clusters of domain objects.
- **Value Objects**: Objects that are immutable and have no identity.
- **Domain Events & Handlers**: Events that represent something which has occurred in the domain.
- **Domain Services**: Services that encapsulate domain logic.
- **Abstractions**: Interfaces and abstract classes to decouple implementations.

## Use Cases Project

The Use Cases project represents the application layer and contains:

- **Commands**: Commands that represent actions to change state.
- **Queries**: Queries to retrieve data.
- **Validation**: Logic for validating commands and queries.
- **Authentication**: Services and logic for authenticating users.
- **Authorization**: Policies and handlers for authorizing user actions.
- **Integration Events**: Events for integrating with other systems or services.

## Infrastructure Project

The Infrastructure project represents the infrastructure layer and contains:

- **Abstraction Implementations**: Implementations of abstractions defined in the Core project.
- **Database Configurations**: Configurations and setup for database connections and migrations.
- **Repositories**: Data access logic to interact with the database.

## API Project

The API project represents the presentation layer and contains:

- **APIs**: Controllers and endpoints to expose application functionality.
- **Service Registration**: Configuration for dependency injection and service setup.
